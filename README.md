# semantic-segmentation
This repository contains our 2nd Course Project on Computer Vision. In this project we have tried to implement both classical and modern approaches to semantic segmentation.For the classical approach we have used Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest.In modern approach we have used U-net and YOLO Model.  We have used different type of datasets for different model.

## Project Details
- The SVM model was used to do segmentation of Sandstone images.
- Random Forest was used on both Sandstone images and Aerial drone images.
- U-net was used on Nuclei dataset.
- YOLO Model was used for the COCO dataset.

## Results
- Random Forest on Aerial Drone Dataset.
- Random Forest on Sandtone Dataset.
- SVM on Aerial Drone Dataset
- U-net on Nuclei Dataset
- YOLO on COCO dataset
